Chess with JavaFX
=================
The Project
-----------
This project is a desktop implementation of classic chess using the JavaFX platform.

Four modes are available in which to play this chess game:
1. 2 player local game - players take turns on a single machine
2. 2 player remote game - connect over a network to another player
3. 1 player vs computer - play against the computer
4. Computer vs computer - watch the computer play itself


Try it out
----------
To try this program, download [chess.jar](../chess.jar). Next execute the chess.jar file from the download location either by double clicking chess.jar, or via the terminal.

**Troubleshooting**  
If the application does not start after attempting to execute chess.jar, it might be for the following reasons:
1. chess.jar does not have execute permissions - `chmod +x chess.jar` on Unix-like systems.
2. The JAR file type is not associated with the JRE installed on your system. [Troubleshoot JAR file associations](https://netbeans.org/kb/articles/javase-deploy.html#troubleshooting)
3. A Java Runtime Environment (JRE) is required to run this application. If your system does not already have a JRE installed, download [JRE](https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase-jre8-downloads.html)

Why this project?
-----------------
I created this personal exploration project to learn more about Java and gain experience using the JavaFX platform. 
This project afforded me additional opportunity to improve my skills in several areas, including threading and networking.
